# Bento Social Share

{% heroexample 'bento-social-share' %}

Displays a sharing button for social platforms or system share.

Currently, none of the buttons generated by Bento Social Share (including those for the pre-configured providers) have a label or accessible name that is exposed to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). Make sure to include an `aria-label` with a descriptive label, as otherwise these controls will just be announced as unlabelled "button" elements.

<div class="bd-usage bd-card bd-card--light-sea-green">
  <p>Use bento-social-share as a web component or a React functional component:</p>
  <a class="bd-button" href="#web-component">↓ Web Component</a>
  <a class="bd-button" href="#preact%2Freact-component">↓ React / Preact</a>
</div>

## Web Component

You must include each Bento component's required CSS library to guarantee proper loading and before adding custom styles. Or use the light-weight pre-upgrade styles available inline. See [Layout and style](#layout-and-style).

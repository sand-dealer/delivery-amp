# Contributing

You don't need to be a developer or a technical writer to make a significant
impact on the TensorFlow documentationâ€”just a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
This guide shows how to make contributions to [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org).

See the
[TensorFlow docs contributor guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs)
for guidance. For questions, the
[docs@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/docs)
mailing list is available.

To contribute to the TensorFlow code repositories, see the
[TensorFlow code contributor guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/code)
and the
[TensorFlow contribution guidelines](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Welcome to the AMP Translation Initiative!

AMP's mission includes making the web a welcoming and accessible place for everyone! This goal is unreachable without localized documentation. The AMP translation initiative is creating a network of native speaking translators. This ensures efficient and clear localized documentation. We can't thank you enough for your contribution in making the web an ecosystem for everyone.

## Ways to Contribute

  * Translate documentation.
  * Update translated documentation.
  * Review translated documentation for accuracy and terminology.
  * Add to localization term glossaries.

## Get Started

AMP has an ongoing internal translation process for documentation. We are working with translation contributors on an effective communication line. This describes what files are in need to external help.

### Currently, our process is:

  1. Find a file to translate.
  1. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/issues/new).
    * Declare into which language you're translating the document.
    * Name which file you wish to translate or update.
    * Give a rough estimation of how much of the file you are translating.
        - Full File
        - Partial File
        - Few Terms
    * Provide a general estimation of how much time it will take to complete the translation task.
    * Add [@CrystalOnScript](https://github.com/CrystalOnScript) so she can triage the localization request and inform you in case there's already somebody working on the same translation:
        - Yes! Please translate this!
        - Thanks for your interest, but the internal team or a volunteer is currently working on this document. You will be added as a reviewer before it goes live.

Some translation contributions participate in Slack channels. We encourage you to join and introduce yourself! Join the [AMP Slack Channel here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd83J2IZA6cdR6jPwABGsJE8YL4pkypAbKMGgUZZriU7Qu6Tg/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877).

### Creating localized files

The [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) website differentiates localized files by suffixing the `@` symbol followed by the appropriate language code to the translated document. For example, `example.md` would become `example@ko.md` if translated to Korean.

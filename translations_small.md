## Get Started

AMP has an ongoing internal translation process for documentation. We are working with translation contributors on an effective communication line. This describes what files are in need to external help.

### Currently, our process is:

  1. Find a file to translate.
  1. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/issues/new).
    * Declare into which language you're translating the document.
    * Name which file you wish to translate or update.
    * Give a rough estimation of how much of the file you are translating.
        - Full File
        - Partial File
        - Few Terms
    * Provide a general estimation of how much time it will take to complete the translation task.
    * Add [@CrystalOnScript](https://github.com/CrystalOnScript) so she can triage the localization request and inform you in case there's already somebody working on the same translation:
        - Yes! Please translate this!
        - Thanks for your interest, but the internal team or a volunteer is currently working on this document. You will be added as a reviewer before it goes live.
